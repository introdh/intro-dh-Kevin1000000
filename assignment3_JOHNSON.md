Assignment 3
Kevin Johnson

This georeferencing assignment required tools and methods that felt unusual for this course. Previously we had worked with in intersection of the humanities and computer science that involved using tools to place humanities questions through computer science, but spatial analysis feels more like it’s own field than a combination of the first two. Involving ArcGIS, the labs and lessons we’ve had have made me understand the larger definition of Digital Humanities, and how questions can be answered in entirely different ways by using wildly different tools. The action of georeferencing, the layering of the historic map over ArcGIS’ map in our lab, was able to get me thinking about questions ranging from topics like history to political science, to economics and more. This proved to me the usefulness of this tool to digital humanists.

Specifically, this map assignment involved taking a map from the Mapping Inequality project done in part by the Digital Scholarship Lab here at U of R, and overlaying the original 1930s map of redlined housing markets on to ArcGIS’ digital map using 2010 census data. I chose the redlined map of Baltimore, Maryland, as it is a city I am familiar with for having a large disparity in the present for housing districts, and one I have grown up near my whole life. Both maps used here, Baltimore’s redlined map and the ArcGIS underlay, detail a large area of the inner city and outer suburbs, and as a result cover a mixture of spaces and places. The spaces defined in this two-map overlay are complex, and rely on data from the original redlined map of housing markets ranging from “Best” (coded language that translates to majority-white and wealthy neighborhood) to “Hazardous” (translates to majority-nonwhite and poor neighborhood), which forces the spaces and places of this assignment to be seen with racial and economic filters.

This map is meant to generate questions about the play on suburban vs. urban living in a city like Baltimore, a city that has seen their population peak and fall significantly between the redlining years and the present (U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division, 2016). Why and how have people moved away from this urban center, and what do the housing districts compare with that knowledge? Another question to consider is the change over time of the racial makeup of Baltimore’s inner city, something that has been in flux for years as gentrification threatens the city’s neighborhoods. These questions can be pulled, and subsequently answered, by the data found in this map overlay. 

For this assignment, I chose US Census tract 1803 in the inner city of Baltimore to focus on these two questions I have asked above, being “what has the population and racial change been over time?” To dive deeper, I used the tool of Social Explorer to understand the tract’s history. As of 2010 census data, this tract had a population of 1,690 people, a low population number comparatively for other neighboring tracts, as many nearby reach above 2,000. Census data from 1930 only gives a total city population, but that year’s number of over 800,000 residents is representative of this change, as 2010 data puts total city population down to 621,000 residents. 

To answer the second part of this question, this tract was redlined in the map from 1937, being considered “Hazardous” for having a “high Negro population”. This note about high Negro population made me question the current African-American population in the tract. I found that as of 2010, the tract had an African-American population of 943 residents, representing 56% of the neighborhood. This area had been listed as “80% Negro” in the 1937 redlined map, which represents a drop in racial population from African-Americans. These tools are remarkable to find this information, as the visualizations representing this information is incredibly informative. 

I find that there are struggles in the amount of layers that maps can reasonably contain, as well as orientation of those maps. Interactive maps from the top-down are very informative, but a more natural use of a digital map would allow for overlays of satellite images, and depending on the data, digital representation of spaces throughout history. Changing this orientation to represent more data in a more visual sense (satellite overlays) would be one change I would find useful for a project like this, and would answer questions about neighborhood layout and housing makeup. Overall, this project allowed for questions to be brought up and represented in entirely new ways, but with changing technology, we can only answer and ask more questions.
