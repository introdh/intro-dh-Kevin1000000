# Grant Workshop


## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

- How has journalism changed in topic, style, and content through the digital media boom of the 21st century?
- What specifically changes when the print version of a publication dies and moves online?

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

News today moves faster than ever, and has adapted to the changing technology of society. With the advent of online readers, mobile phones, social media, and more, news reaches people quicker and more direct today than it has in the history of the journalism trade. With this, the (not so) old standard of print media has begun to makes changes to these models, bringing down historic print publications in the process. This would be the subject of this project, as I look to use Topic Modeling of small, regional publications (Village Voice, etc) both in their print and online forms to compare and contrast the topics, style and content of these out-of-print, on-to-digital news outlets in both versions. I am interested to look for the largest differences in these areas of journalism, as I am curious to see the most prominent aspects of digital medis and print media, and gain understanding into how publications can survive after being forced to move to print. 

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in 







## Peer Review

- Is the question and/or abstract too vague or too broad?
- Where would the data come from? Does it need to be created? Potential sources?
- Could this project be accomplished in 1-2 years?
- Is there a similar project already in process?
