### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
Kathryn Schultz, "What is Distant Reading?"
1. “He advocates what he terms 'distant reading': understanding literature not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data.” - This quote is the lede of this article, which brings out the main point of the author in explaining Moretti’s theory. The a-ha moment came from the understanding of the distant methodology, and making connections to the data collection we’ve done in class.
2. “Literature, he argues, is “a collective system that should be grasped as such.” But this, too, is a theology of sorts — if not the claim that literature is a system, at least the conviction that we can find meaning only in its totality.” - The author begins to lose me with this quote, as I am left questioning Moretti’s theology, and whether the author agrees with him or disagrees. 

Franco Moretti, *Graphs, Maps, Trees*
1. “Is this wave-like pattern a sort of hidden pendulum of literary history?” - This sentence displayed an a-ha moment for me, not for what explicitly is said in the sentence, but the fact that Moretti is able to use the example of genre lifespans to greater display the lack of information that close reading presents, and how graphs can lead us to find questions and examples like these. I was then able to understand how a graph can be a tool useful in digital humanities, through questioning and interpreting of data.
2. “But the real point, here, is less the specific answer, than the total heterogeneity of problem and solution: to make sense of quantitative data, I had to abandon the quantitative universe, and turn to morphology: evoke form, in order to explain figures.” - This sentence was a bit confusing to me, as in the text of this chapter, Moretti did indeed abandon the quantitative universe to make sense of quantitative data, through looking at the context of society, politics, and more. However, Moretti turns to morphology, which is a previously unused method, and I am left wondering if morphology or if looking at context is a better tool to explain quantitative data.

Matthew Jockers, *Macroanalysis*
1. “Observation is flawed in the same way that generalization from the specific is flawed: the generalization may be good, it may even explain a total population, but the selection of the sample is always something less than perfect, and so the observed results are likewise imperfect.” - This was an a-ha moment for me, as it was a description of experimentation as part of research that felt equatable to the humanities and the sciences alike. This conclusion can be brought to both areas of research, which allows me to understand the comparisons and contrasts made between the two.
2. “By way of an analogy, we might think about interpretive close readings as corresponding to microeconomics, whereas quantitative distant reading corresponds to macroeconomics. Consider, then, the study of literary genres or literary periods: are they macroanalytic?” - This quote is where the author begins to get confusing by talking about micro and macroeconomics, which feels like a misleading comparison to start. Wouldn’t the study of micro and macroeconomics be different than the digital humanities work of close and distant reading in that the tool set for studying one is the same for studying the other in economics, but not in the digital humanities? That is the way I interpreted the author’s point, and I was confused by the comparison for the rest of the reading.
