## Reading Prompt

For each reading, pick two sentence/passages. One should be where the had an AHA! moment and one that is unclear, confusing, or needs further explanation. Provide a sentence or two explaining each of your selections.  Provide your response below.

 

### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
Kathryn Schultz, "What is Distant Reading?"
1. “He advocates what he terms 'distant reading': understanding literature not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data.” - This quote is the lede of this article, which brings out the main point of the author in explaining Moretti’s theory. The a-ha moment came from the understanding of the distant methodology, and making connections to the data collection we’ve done in class.
2. “Literature, he argues, is “a collective system that should be grasped as such.” But this, too, is a theology of sorts — if not the claim that literature is a system, at least the conviction that we can find meaning only in its totality.” - The author begins to lose me with this quote, as I am left questioning Moretti’s theology, and whether the author agrees with him or disagrees. 

Franco Moretti, *Graphs, Maps, Trees*
1. “Is this wave-like pattern a sort of hidden pendulum of literary history?” - This sentence displayed an a-ha moment for me, not for what explicitly is said in the sentence, but the fact that Moretti is able to use the example of genre lifespans to greater display the lack of information that close reading presents, and how graphs can lead us to find questions and examples like these. I was then able to understand how a graph can be a tool useful in digital humanities, through questioning and interpreting of data.
2. “But the real point, here, is less the specific answer, than the total heterogeneity of problem and solution: to make sense of quantitative data, I had to abandon the quantitative universe, and turn to morphology: evoke form, in order to explain figures.” - This sentence was a bit confusing to me, as in the text of this chapter, Moretti did indeed abandon the quantitative universe to make sense of quantitative data, through looking at the context of society, politics, and more. However, Moretti turns to morphology, which is a previously unused method, and I am left wondering if morphology or if looking at context is a better tool to explain quantitative data.

Matthew Jockers, *Macroanalysis*
1. “Observation is flawed in the same way that generalization from the specific is flawed: the generalization may be good, it may even explain a total population, but the selection of the sample is always something less than perfect, and so the observed results are likewise imperfect.” - This was an a-ha moment for me, as it was a description of experimentation as part of research that felt equatable to the humanities and the sciences alike. This conclusion can be brought to both areas of research, which allows me to understand the comparisons and contrasts made between the two.
2. “By way of an analogy, we might think about interpretive close readings as corresponding to microeconomics, whereas quantitative distant reading corresponds to macroeconomics. Consider, then, the study of literary genres or literary periods: are they macroanalytic?” - This quote is where the author begins to get confusing by talking about micro and macroeconomics, which feels like a misleading comparison to start. Wouldn’t the study of micro and macroeconomics be different than the digital humanities work of close and distant reading in that the tool set for studying one is the same for studying the other in economics, but not in the digital humanities? That is the way I interpreted the author’s point, and I was confused by the comparison for the rest of the reading.


### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I
Megan R. Brett, "Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction."
1. “Newspapers have proved to be a popular subject for topic modeling, as it provides a way to get at change over time from a daily source.” - This quote is an a-ha moment for me, as it and the following example in the text are able to connect my field of study, journalism, to this process of topic modeling, connecting how I understand digital humanities and what this tool could be used for.
2. “How the actual topic modeling programs is determined by mathematics. Many topic modeling articles include equations to explain the mathematics, but I personally cannot parse them.” - This quote is what gives me pause in my understanding of Topic Modeling. I understand that the author is using this article to generalize about topic modeling, but as a practical tool that I will be using, I would have liked a deeper explanation on the methods and mathematics of how most modeling tech works.

Elijah Meeks and Scott Weingart, "The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling."
1. “One particular variety of topic model, an approach called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), along with its various derivatives, has been the most popular approach to topic modeling in the humanities.” - This introduction to LDA is my a-ha moment, as it is a easy-to-follow and focused definition of a method that applies directly to DH for topic modeling, which has a widespread useage that doesn’t always relate to DH.
2. “While there is a hefty bibliography for spatial analysis in humanities scholarship, for example, in order to follow research that deploys topic modeling for humanities inquiry you must read blogs and attend conference presentations and workshops.” - This was an aspect of the text that confused me, as I did not understand why the author was adamant about those who wish to use topic modeling in DH be involved in the conversation actively.

Cameron Blevins, *Topic Modeling and Martha Ballard's Diary*
1. “It helped me to think of the entire diary list as a warehouse containing almost 10,000 boxes (entries) inside it, with each box containing five compartments, with the first of those compartments divided into three sub-compartments.” - Cameron Blevins’ description of this diary put the entire project in perspective to me. The sheer size alone is staggering, and to think about it like this, it makes it sound organizationally feasible. There is a lot in each of the parts of Blevins’ writing that is able to explain the use of these tools for DH, and I find that her encapsulation of the scale of this project is a useful take away from the reading.
2. "Using these parameters, the program could iterate through the text and recognize the occurrence of a delivery. Now we could begin to organize these births." - I believe I was thrown off by this point in the second part of the reading, as I just didn’t understand the motivation behind charting these births. I found it more important to find commonalities in her text and daily notes rather than the job she performed, a job that she didn’t necessarily mention every day in the diary. Why would a humanist want to chart something like this?

Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood, "What Can Topic Models of PMLA Teach Us About the History of Literary Scholarship?"
1. “By forcing us to attend to concrete linguistic practice, topic modeling gives us a chance to bracket our received assumptions about the connections between concepts.” - This example allows me to understand the specific requirements and limits of topic modeling, and the considerations that need to be in place to produce useful data.
2. "And this is the point: a “topic” is neither more nor less than a pattern of co-occurring words." - This point is made clear in the text and through the example of the Italian text being lumped together, but this would make me think that some “topics” will be gathered incorrectly and produce useless results from the topic modeling? An unclear moment for me in this reading.
