This assignment was to encompass a data set and visualize it in a network, as we have discussed in class. I became personally interested in the data set that I chose, the supreme court cases involving the intricacies of the first amendment to the US constitution, as a result of a journalism law class I am taking. In class lectures, we discussed court cases that formed our current legal view of the first amendment, which has definitions that range as a result of a broad definition over free publication and speech. Looking at the larger data set given to us in class, I wanted to see how first amendment rights cases can connect to one another and influence the other, as this area of communications law can change definitions within decades depending on court rulings. I took major inspiration from the work of political science professors James H. Fowler and Sangick Jeon from their scholarly project; “The Authority of the Supreme Court precedent,” which worked to network more than 30 thousand majority opinions of the SCOTUS in order to assess authority from decision to decision.

In processing my network of Supreme Court cases regarding the first amendment, I found visualizations that forced my perspective into a specific area of network analysis we learned in class; centrality. Inspired by the Fowler and Jeon project, the main questions I had focused around importance or authority of certain cases over others. I began by asking, what are some of the most central cases for First Amendment rights, how have these cases influenced other cases linked in the network, and the legal system as a whole? As it turns out, first amendment cases center strongly around a small number of cases, centralizing their referencing to a few landmarks in the supreme court system. An example of one of these oft-referenced cases is NAACP v Button, this network’s most-centralized case (seen in yellow in the image below).

After networking this map, I was left asking why so few cases acted as the touchstone in deciding many other cases? After all, this network included a large number of clusters, meaning these cases do not share many specifics with each other, as seen in the image below.

These fourteen clusters represent the disparate areas of first amendment law these cases contain. But as for the explanation to my main question, I was able to understand that a case like NAACP v Button covers a broad enough expanse of first amendment law to be applicable to many cases regarding the first amendment. The NAACP sued the Virginia Attorney General Robert Button for infringing very broadly on the first amendment rights (assembly and speech, specifically) of the NAACP as a corporation, as Button’s push for what he called “massive resistance” to desegregation was in violation of the first amendment. This broad decision links first amendment cases together through the establishment of free speech and assembly rights for more than just individuals, but corporations and groups. Establishing this meant that many more cases could be brought to trial, and this resulted in such. 

Being able to reach that conclusion through this network was eye opening, as an interactive visualization provided the links between court cases that would take a law textbook chapters to conduct. As well, looking at the work done by Fowler and Jeon going further into networking Supreme Court decisions, it is clear there are many opportunities to discover specific elements of these cases, including voting patterns, citations, majority and minority decisions and more (Fowler and Jeon, ScienceDirect, 2008). The limitations may only become visible for this form of humanities analysis when one moves away from a data set like Supreme Court cases, as not every humanities data set would be mappable much like these are. To be able to look at legal issues through networking presents a user-friendly option for law analysis, one that doesn't require a nuanced knowledge of legal systems.
