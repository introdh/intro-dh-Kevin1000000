Digital Humanities Assignment 2: Topic Modeling

  For this project, I chose to dive into a journal of writing on music, titled Popular Music. This journal, in publication since 1981 by the Cambridge University Press, features writing from music journalists, musicologists, historians, and more to cover a wide variety of themes, topics and issues around popular music throughout history. Specifically, the data used in this topic model is a corpus of 700 articles published throughout the 30 volumes held in JSTOR’s database. This data produced fascinating results that forced me to think about the themes and concerns of music writing on a larger scale.

  This topic model of the data includes 30 topics, a number I chose for one main reason. Going into this project, I was aware that I had less documents than other journals would have given me, which allowed me to pull more specific themes from my set with less topics needed than others. For example, if a 1,500-document corpus needed 50 topics to gather highly specific themes, my corpus of 700 documents would need only 30 to gain the same level of specificity. This is the reasoning I had in choosing my topic number.

  My motivation for topic modeling this corpus came from two main questions I had going into this project. The first, which is a two part question, was what do music writers care and write about most, and at what frequency do they do this? This is a question I was excited to see answered by this data, as Popular Music is a very well-known and respected publication, and could provide content from expert music writers to answer this question. The second question I had was how do music writers think when it comes to their subjects? This question required me to look at the data from the corpus in a unique way, as I had to pull from the topic model’s themes to get a sense of the writer’s intent and discern a thought process out of broad themes. Beyond my own curiosity, I was inspired to look for movements within musical texts, from a quote in the Weingart and Meeks article we read for class, “Just as tools are enshrined methodologies, methods like topic modeling are reflections of movements.” (Weingart and Meeks, Journal of Digital Humanities, 2012). It was these influences that made me look critically at the outcome of this assignment.

  This project produced results that impressed and surprised me more than my initial questions had led me to think about. The most clear result I found was a divide of writings in this corpus between themes of race, culture and society. This is something I was not expecting, as I did not first understand how a musicologist would be able to work with these topics in writings about music. The breadth of topics that were presented to me after the modeling was completed provided more context for this result, as I found that often the tokens that stood out in topic models were not the standard descriptions for music, like music terminology, but were the descriptors for kinds of music, and cultural and historical writing relied heavily on those sorts of descriptors, therefore making the model focus largely on the racial, cultural and societal writings within the corpus. 

  Inspired by Cameron Blevins and her topic model of the Martha Ballard diary, I looked for a pattern throughout time in the texts, as she looked for the changes in Ballard’s writing as she aged (Blevins, personal blog, 10-19-2009). My result was similar to Blevins’ in that I found a topical and tonal shift in the corpus as new genres emerged, like the metal and grunge explosion in the 1990s. This was a remarkable result, as it was able to answer parts of my questions I had coming into the project, in that I discovered the sorts of topics that music writers cover most frequently across decades. 

  Based on both this assignment and the readings we’ve discussed in class, the possibilities of topic modeling can really be seen through a wide array of corpuses and angles of inquiry. Nothing feels out of reach or not likely to produce interesting results.
