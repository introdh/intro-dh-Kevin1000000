For this assignment, the topic that I wanted to base my research around was a topic I am familiar with both personally and professionally — music. I decided to look at one of the best-selling and highest-charting musical artists in the 21st century, Jay-Z, and the success he has had with Timbaland, a high-charting and best-selling record producer. His work with and without Timbaland on all 14 of his albums is charted in the two tables. I wanted to use this data to ask questions about Jay-Z, like where his success comes from, at what level does the work of Timbaland make a Jay-Z album a hit, and how does this correlate to Timbaland’s work with other popular artists. Those questions grew naturally from the process of charting this data, and have inspired me to think deeper and how data is collected in the digital humanities and what it can be used for. 

My sources for the information in these tables are the [Grammy Awards website](https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards), Billboard Magazine’s [Chart history page](http://www.billboard.com/artist/304305/jay-z/chart?f=30) for Jay-Z, Jay-Z’s [Album Sales Statistics webpage](http://www.statisticbrain.com/jay-z-album-sale-statistics/) and Wikipedia’s [Jay-Z album discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z_albums_discography).
