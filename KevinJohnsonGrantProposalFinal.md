# Diagnosing Print Media’s Death through Topic Modeling
## A Grant Proposal to the National Endowment for the Humanities

By Kevin Johnson


**Section I: Enhancing the Humanities**

The common trope that has occured about journalism in the present is that print is dying, and moving online into digital publishing is how some publications are able to stay alive, despite still being in a slumping industry. As a journalism major, I have questioned the accuracy of this trope, as I have a financial and occupational stake in the changes of the media landscape. Through trade research, I have found that there is certain proof that media has taken a hit in the print sector and that digital is on the rise, coming majorly from a shift in advertising revenue with changing technology. The most startling number associated with print’s demise is the overall loss of revenue from 2000 to 2015, print media’s darkest days in history. Within this 15 year span, ad revenue dropped from 60 billion to 20 billion, completely wiping out the growth the industry has seen over the past 50 years.

While this fact insinuates a sharp decline in print media through a loss of ad revenue, a closer look at the shift in ad revenue points toward a more steady, structural change in how advertising money can shift the journalism industry. According to the Pew Research Center for Journalism and Media, during the past five years, newspaper ad revenue has maintained a consistent trajectory: Print ads have produced less revenue (down 5%), while digital ads have produced more revenue (up 3%) – but not enough to make up for the fall in print revenue. Overall ad revenue fell 4%, to just $19.9 billion. These numbers are indicative of an adapting industry, but as this form changes, what does it mean for the work that this industry produces? This is the humanities question my project poses and would like to address. 
This project’s main focus is to topic model and data mine specific publications that have fallen victim from this shift, and shuttered their printing presses in exchange for web servers. I intend to pull topics from corpuses of these publications from before and after they went out of print and moved online, in order to collect differences in themes and styles to better understand the effect of the collapse of the print industry on this discipline. The work of journalists and writers contributing to these publications is the beating heart of this billion dollar industry, and this project aims to grasp the state of writing and the “beats” of culture, investigative news, sports, and more, while distinguishing the changes in content, quality, length and other possible differences that may arise from accomplishing this project. 

This project largest challenge lies in its scope. For this project to accurately grasp the effect of the industry’s change, the publications chosen require specific elements. They must be well-read with high circulation numbers, they must have gone out of print for no reason other than insufficient support from advertisers in the print industry, and they must be publications covering similar topical areas in similar styles. And in order to collect enough data to gather a sufficient overview, there must be a decent number of publications used that fit those qualifiers. The scope, based on that information, will cover six publications that I have researched that fit these requirements, and will include a topic model of twenty topics pulled from archives of the publication before and after their moves to digital. Those publications are listed below:

+ *The Village Voice* (Alternative Weekly, New York City, In Print from 1955-2017)
+ *The Independent* (Newspaper, London, U.K., In Print from 1986-2016)
+ *The Seattle Post-Intelligencer* (Newspaper, Seattle, WA., In Print from 1863-2009)
+ *The Capital Times* (Newspaper, Madison, WI., In Print from 1917-2008)
+ *Newsweek* (News Magazine, New York City, In Print from 1933-2012, 2013- ) 
+ *Jet* (News Magazine, New York City, In Print from 1955-2014)

**Newsweek was out of print for a brief period of time before reviving their print version in 2013. For this project I will be using the corpus created during their time as an online-only publication.*

Through these six publications, I hope to collect topics that represent the current media landscape in a digital form, as well as the previous media landscape of a dominant print sector, with the hope of disseminating this information to various media contributors. 

The tools I plan on incorporating into this project include the program Mallet, a software project that is useful for language processing, cluster analysis, information extraction, topic modeling and other machine learning applications to text. My personal experience with Mallet was a strong influence on the focus of my project, as I was interested in the possibility of mining texts and producing larger themes and topics from a dense and sizeable corpus. The form of LDA topic modeling used in my prior topic modeling project (that of the musicology journal Popular Music) produced results I had not expected about the corpus, and I intend to look for surprising or unique results in a similar manner with this project on a much larger scale. The possibilities of these tools can uncover major textual movements in journalism, and with this project I intend to share those results with the industry at large.

This project aims to tackle the shifting mediums that journalism faces, with the hope that those in the media industry would be able to take some of these findings into account as this industry adapts for a new era. As editors, journalists navigate this industry through their careers, this information could aid those who work practically in the field to understand what would bring advertising revenue to the industry while understanding the faults or successes of print and digital journalism. As well, as publishing scholars, journalism professors and media industry experts begin to look inward at this change, being aware of the possible effects of this change, including changes to editing, writing, researching, publishing, and publication of journalism is crucial to keep the discipline alive. Not only would this project aid the discipline and industry of journalism, but this can contribute to the humanities at large. The information pulled from these topic models would be contributable to the publishing industry of literature, as their work shares a similar fate with a shift in revenue from changing technology. By using topic modeling to gather information on the changes of journalism and pairing with digital humanities, this project will aid in growing awareness of the shift, and could influence a change in the media landscape. 

**Section II: Environmental Scan**

To approach this project, it is important to be aware of the existing projects that may aid or influence this work in a positive way. In conducting an environmental scan of similar work, there are three projects currently bearing similarities to my goals with this proposal. The Viral Texts project, sponsored by Northeastern University and a recipient of funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities’ Office of Digital Humanities, is a network and topic model analysis of texts that “went viral” so to speak in nineteenth century publications. This project analyzed the qualities of text in journalism in much a similar way to my intention with this project, giving me a strong example of how the Digital Humanities can be adapted to this discipline, while also being able to provide a unique purpose for my conclusions. This project used the tool sets of topic modeling and networking to visualize texts that have been reprinted, in an effort to show connections between publications and how the written language was shared and spread during this time of print publication. With this project in mind, I intend to use topic modeling of modern texts to do a large-scale literary analysis and work on a visualization similar to Viral Texts. However, unlike this project, my project will not include work with networking, as my intention is not to link publications to one another through a visualized network, but to find similarities and differences with textual analysis in a wide variety of text from similar publications, something that does not lend itself to networking and would only distract from the topic models of modern print and digital journalism. 

Another project that will aid me in this is the data mining and topic modeling project Robots Reading Vogue. This project, sponsored by Yale’s Digital Humanities program, aligns with my intention to data mine publications, but differences in a conclusion. I intend to come out of this project with a more general conclusion about the state of journalism as a whole, something that Robots Reading Vogue did not attempt. Their project mined issues of Vogue magazine to collect data on the fashion industry and their representation in Vogue, narrowing their scope down to a single publication and a single topic. While their work is much more focused than my intentions, my project can still learn from the layout of this project and their method of data collection and analysis. 

A third project I would look to is the “Signs at 40” topic model we approached in class. This archive analysis is aimed to curate the content of the feminist journal Signs over 40 years, and uses the tools of data mining and topic modeling much in a similar way to the other projects I look to for inspiration. The visualization tool used by this project of the color-coated topics over time chart is something I would find very applicable in my work, as I am dealing with topical changes in prominence over a period of time. Overall, the use of data mining, text analysis and topic modeling in analyzing journalism can vary from project to project depending on the goal, but these three projects provide my project with strong examples of how best to approach this work. 

**Section III: History of the Work**

This project’s history has been informed by a combination of prior experience with this form of digital humanities, as well as texts crucial to understanding the importance of topic modeling in the digital humanities. As mentioned earlier, it was a topic model I compiled on the musicology publication Popular Music that informed my practical understanding of the tools of Mallet and LDA topic modeling, as I was able to conduct textual analysis that revealed major themes that inspired me to look through important corpuses beyond Popular Music, bringing me to this grant proposal. As well, the work of Cameron Blevins, a digital humanities researcher and professor at Northwestern University, informed my proposal. Specifically, it was Blevins’ Text Analysis of Martha Ballard’s Diary, a project that compiled data from the diary of a Maine midwife, was a strong example of how this sort of work can be used to look for specific results from text analysis, yet also be open to the unexpected results. It was these two projects that informed the history of this grant proposal, and will continue to inform the work this project would accomplish with funding. 

**Section IV: Work Plan**

The work plan for this project would be labor intensive and include a shared workload among 20 data collectors, topic modellers, and journalism professors to pour through the data collected. To begin, a corpus would have to be pulled for each publication from two years of publication in print, and two years of publication online, this is something that a team of six data collectors would work to achieve in a matter of one month. After this is complete, a team of six topic modelers would use the computer program Mallet installed on six individual consoles to run the program and produce topic models of these publications from the corpuses given, occurring over the span of one week. Once the topics have been collected and placed into a visualized form, a team of seven journalism experts and professors and myself would begin to scan the data pulled from the corpuses, looking for similarities and differences and understanding the results of this data. This final step could possibly take one month to complete, depending on the results of the topic models. 

This project would face the issues of possibly not coming to a distinct conclusion about the state online and print journalism facing the shift in revenue, as it is possible these news outlets we will be topic modelling could not contain an adequate representation of print and online media. To mitigate these risks, we will emphasize that the number of topics we pull from these corpuses could change if need be, as well as the span of time the corpuses could cover. This would add time to the project, but overall could benefit in producing a better scan of journalism in print and online. 

**Section V: Staff**

The staff for this project would include a team of 20 people, and would pull heavily from the graduate program of Digital Humanities from Northeastern University. Six students from this program would act as the data collectors, while another six would be the topic modellers using Mallet. The remaining members would include myself, as well as a number of journalism professors from The University of Missouri School of Journalism and Syracuse University’s Communications Department. 

**Section VI: Final Product and Dissemination**

This product would be best disseminated through a series of printed articles in journalism trade journals including Poynter, as well as journalism scholarly journals like Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly. The team of professors and media experts who aided in understanding the topics produced by this project would be adept at disseminating the findings to these sources, and could possibly contribute these findings into a larger collection of articles published in a select issue of a journalism trade journal or scholarly journal. This information will also be hosted in a blog form online, and would be accessible for free. In addition, to aid the disabled to acquire this information, a podcast could be created to disseminate this information to the visually impaired that would detail the findings of this project. The white paper resulting from this project will be made available to all in the journalism field, and will concisely detail these findings in order to aid both academic journalists and in-field journalists and editors. This project aims to use digital humanities to investigate how the discipline of journalism could be affected by the shift in the media industry. To collect this data and translate the results into a thesis about the state of journalism in these changing times will offer understanding into an opaque challenge for the discipline.
